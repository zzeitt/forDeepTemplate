## Folder Structure
Basically, a deep-learning project looks like this.
```
.
└── [PROJECT_ROOT]/
    ├── assets/
    │   └── [assets work for the project]
    ├── docs/
    │   └── [documents for illustration]
    ├── env/
    │   └── [portable `conda` environment]
    ├── gui/
    │   └── [GUI is good]
    ├── models/
    │   └── [put networks here]
    └── scripts/
        └── [put utils here]
```

## Miscellaneous
